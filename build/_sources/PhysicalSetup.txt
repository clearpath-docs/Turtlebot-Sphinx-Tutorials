Physical Setup
===============  

The first step in setting up your TurtleBot is to have a connection between the TurtleBot netbook, the Kobuki base, and the Kinect camera. The netbook is connected through a USB port on the netbook to an USB type B port on the Kobuki (1).The Kinect camera is connected to an adapter(3), which then plugs into a USB 2.0 port on the netbook, and into the 12V 1.5A connector on the Kobuki(2). Once step three in this guide is completed, you can close the netbook and place it on the bottom shelf of your TurtleBot.
